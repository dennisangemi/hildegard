Be thou my vision, Oh Lord of my heart
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art
Thou my best thought, by day or by night
Walking or sleeping, Thy presence my linght

Be thou my wisdom, and Thou my true word
I ever whit Thee, and Thou with me Lord
Thou my great Father, and I Thy true son
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one

Be thou my battle shiedl, sword for the fight
Be Thou my dignity, Thou my delight
Thou my soul's shelter, Thou my high tow'r
Raise Thou me heav'nward, Oh pow'r of my pow'r

Reaches I heed not, nor man's empty praise
Thou mine inheritance now and always
Thou and Thou only, first in my heart
HIgh King of heaven, my treasure Thou art

High King of Heaven, my victory won
May I reach Heaven's joys, oh bright Heaven's Sun!
Hert of my own hert whatever befall
Still be my vision oh Ruler of all
